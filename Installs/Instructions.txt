Install python - (Python 3.12.7 - Oct. 1, 2024):

https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Set the environment variable:

python -m venv venv

Once python is installed execute this command in the "backend" directory:

Install the application dependencies:

py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

OR

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If you get any errors, try installing them seperatly in this order:

py -m pip install flask==2.3.3
py -m pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.0.5
py -m pip install Flask-CORS==4.0.0
py -m pip install python-dotenv==1.0.0
py -m pip install requests==2.31.0
py -m pip install schedule==1.2.0

py -m pip install pandas --prefer-binary


Once all is installed execute the backend with:

python app.py

Once the backend is running you will see:

	D:\Other\flight-co2-calculator\backend>python app.py
	✅ Configuration system available
	✅ Configuration loaded from config.json
	✅ Enhanced features are available
	 * Serving Flask app 'app'
	 * Debug mode: on
	WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
	 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080
	Press CTRL+C to quit
	 * Restarting with stat
	✅ Configuration system available

	✅ Automation scheduler started successfully
	✅ Automation scheduler started successfully


Then change the directory to the frontend and execute with:

npm run dev

Once the frontend is running you will see:

		(venv) D:\Other\flight-co2-calculator>cd frontend

		(venv) D:\Other\flight-co2-calculator\frontend>npm run dev

		> flight-co2-calculator@0.0.0 dev
		> vite


		  VITE v4.5.14  ready in 1611 ms

		  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
		  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
		  ➜  press h to show help
  
  Open: "http://localhost:5173/" in your browser and everything should work.
  

If you get any errors on the frontend you can change the "localhost" in the "backend" (app.py) file to:

	Stop both apps first then:

		if __name__ == '__main__':
			app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080, debug=True)

	and also change the "frontend" in the (vite.config.js) file to:

		target: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080',

Start both apps and test again.
